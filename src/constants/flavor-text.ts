// Just random, wacky flavor text for this game set in the Roman Empire.
// I want it to read like a Monty Python skit or Satirical "Local News" Headlines about life in Ancient Rome.
// I want them to be funny and short (a sentence or so). They have to be stuff that could plausibly happen in the setting or in Roman mythology.
